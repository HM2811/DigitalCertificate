This project demonstrates how to **establish a secure communication channel** between a **Java server** and **client** using **self-signed certificates**. By following the outlined steps, you will be able to implement SSL/TLS encryption for communication.

---
*Steps*
Step 1: Generate Self-Signed Certificates
Generate the necessary self-signed certificates for both the server and the client. This will allow both parties to authenticate each other and establish a secure connection.

Step 2: Export the Server's Certificate
Export the server's certificate from the server's keystore. This certificate will be shared with the client to enable secure communication.

Step 3: Import the Server's Certificate into the Client's Truststore
Import the exported server certificate into the client's truststore. The truststore ensures the client can trust the serverâ€™s certificate when establishing a connection.

Step 4: Server Implementation
Implement the server side of the communication. The server will listen for incoming connections, authenticate itself using its certificate, and handle secure communication with the client.

Step 5: Client Implementation
Implement the client side of the communication. The client will authenticate the serverâ€™s certificate, establish a secure connection, and communicate with the server.
